However, on 15 May 2018, days after finishing third in the league, several players and coaches were attacked by around 50 ultra supporters of Sporting at the club's training ground (9 of them would be sentenced to at least a specified term of actual imprisonment after trial). Five days later, Sporting lost the Portuguese Cup final to Aves. About a month later, Bruno de Carvalho was dismissed by club members after a general assembly on 23 June. This followed the rescissions of nine players: Bruno Fernandes, Daniel Podence, Rui Patricio, Rodrigo Battaglia, Rafael Leão, Rúben Ribeiro,  Bas Dost, Gelson Martins and William Carvalho. Sporting would be later eligible for court-awarded compensation when the rescissions were declared illegal for those players who did not return to the club or were not sold by Sporting.","[-0.0200351   0.01975951  0.02404487 ... -0.02039336 -0.0001126

On 25 October 1908, Sporting Clube de Portugal presented the first ten football shirts that would come to be known as the Stromp kit. The initiative came from founder Eduardo Quintela de Mendonça. The Stromp kit is split at the top, with the right half white and the left half painted green. It was named in honour of one of the club's main founders, Francisco Stromp, and it had white shorts, with the shorts changing to black in 1915. It stopped being used as the main jersey in 1928.  On 6 November 1927, the horizontally striped green and white jerseys that Salazar Carreira, sportsman and sports manager linked to the club since 1912, had chosen for the club's rugby team in 1926 were worn by the football team for the first time in a friendly match against Casa Pia, but after that the Stromp kit continued to be used. When Sporting's football team travelled to Brazil in July 1928, and after considering the weather conditions in that country, it was decided to wear the horizontally striped jerseys because they were lighter and tighter to the body. On their return, the Sporting's football team once again wore the traditional split jerseys known as the Stromp kit. However, on 5 October 1928, in a match against Benfica, whether it was because of the heavy rain that made them too heavy, or for some other reason, at half-time the players swapped their usual jerseys for the striped ones, thus establishing what is still the club's main kit today: green and white horizontally stripped jersey with black shorts.","[-0.00513414  0.00213618  0.01796783 ...  0.00026536  0.00294306
