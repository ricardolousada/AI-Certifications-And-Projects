# This is the folder with the Generative AI Nanodegree from Udacity

This is a nanodegre in an era where generative AI is reshaping the landscape of software development, 
the Generative AI Nanodegree program delves into essential skills to apply these cutting-edge technologies to
enhance the development of software applications. The program addresses the growing demand for expertise in adapting
generative foundation models, crafting custom applications using large language models (LLMs), and
employing advanced techniques like Stable Diffusion.

## Generative AI Fundamentals

Dive into generative AI with this course, which explores its fundamental principles and relationship to prior artificial intelligence innovations. We will walk through popular generative models and how they work, how deep learning models are developed using tools like PyTorch and Hugging Face, and finally, how to customize pre-trained open-source models for a specific use case. In the project, you will apply a cutting-edge technique called parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which allows for the adaptation of massive foundation models with minimal usage of computational resources.
